# BankApplication-OOPS-Concept

 Bank Management Software

One should be able to deposit money and withdraw money from a particular account as the user desires.

There should be a validation to allow only a particular amount of cash inflows at any time, as well as to allow withdraws if the balance is sufficient. 

There should also be the calculation of interest and its addition to the balance every month.
